# messenger-oophp-ajax-flexbox
A dummy messenger website which enables chatting with logged in users

This is a dummy messenger website that enables logged-in users to chat among themselves. It has the following features:
1. User authentication
2. Sending chat items including text, image, and files- pdf, zip, word, xlsx
3. Displaying current online users
4. Cleaning chat history
5. Updating user data including- name, password, and photo

The design of each page was done with pure HTML and CSS. CSS flexbox was used in particular. For sending and retriving users' chat items, Ajax was used and OOPHP was used as backend development. User forms were sanitized and kept safe from XRR attacks and other potential attacks from unauthenticated users.
